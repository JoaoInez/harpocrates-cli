## Getting Started

You need to already have Node.js installed in your system, so you can install the CLI using NPM

```
$ npm install -g harpocrates-cli
```

Then you just have to initialize the CLI with the command

```
$ harpocrates init
```

After the initialization you're set! If you need any help with the commands simply run

```
$ harpocrates --help
```

or

```
$ harpocrates [command] --help
```

if you need help with a specific command.
